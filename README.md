This project focuses on bulk RNA-seq data from skin graft transplant models to identify global gene expression changes associated with graft rejection and immune activation. Bulk RNA-seq complements the single-cell analysis by capturing tissue-level immune responses.

**Data Type**

-Bulk RNA-seq

-Skin graft transplant tissue

-Experimental groups reflecting different immune outcomes

**Methods and Tools**

-Linux-based RNA-seq pipeline

-FastQC for quality control

-Trimmomatic for read trimming

-HISAT2 for alignment

-featureCounts for read quantification

-DESeq2 for differential expression analysis

-Downstream pathway and immune gene interpretation

**Workflow Summary**

1. Raw read quality assessment

2. Adapter and quality trimming

3. Alignment to reference genome

4. Gene-level quantification

5. Differential expression analysis

6. Immune-focused interpretation of results
